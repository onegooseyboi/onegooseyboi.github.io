I"I<p>Now this is the story all about how<br />
My life got flipped, turned upside down<br />
And I’d like to take a minute just sit right there<br />
I’ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air</p>

<p>In west Philadelphia born and raised<br />
On the playground where I spent most of my days<br />
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool<br />
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school<br />
When a couple of guys, they were up to no good<br />
Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br />
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br />
And said “You’re moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air”</p>

<p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near the<br />
License plate said “fresh” and had a dice in the mirror<br />
If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br />
But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-air!</p>

<p>I pulled up to a house about seven or eight<br />
And I yelled to the cabby “Yo, homes smell you later!”<br />
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there<br />
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-air</p>
